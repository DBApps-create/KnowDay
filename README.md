PrivacyPolicy
Overview
Knowday is a daily fun-facts app that allows users to read facts, answer short questions, build streaks, and save favorite facts. The app is designed to work without creating an account and without collecting personal identifying information.
Data We Collect
Knowday may collect limited, anonymous data to ensure the app works properly and to improve the user experience.
This may include:
• Anonymous usage data, such as app opens, completed daily facts, streak length, and feature usage
• Basic diagnostic data, such as crash reports and performance information
• General device information, such as operating system version and app version
This data is collected in an aggregated and anonymized form and cannot be used to identify you personally.
Data We Do Not Collect
Knowday does not collect:
• Names
• Email addresses
• Phone numbers
• Contacts
• Photos or media
• Precise location data
• Payment information
• User accounts or login credentials
How We Use Data
Collected data is used only to:
• Maintain app functionality, such as streak tracking
• Understand general usage trends
• Improve app stability and performance
• Improve the overall user experience
Data is never used for advertising or profiling.
Data Sharing
Knowday does not sell, rent, or trade your data.
Anonymous analytics data may be processed by a trusted analytics provider solely for usage statistics and diagnostics. No personal data is shared with third parties.
Data Retention
Anonymous data is kept only as long as necessary for analytics and performance monitoring. Wherever possible, data is aggregated and retained for a limited period.
Your Rights
Because Knowday does not collect personal identifying data or user accounts, there is generally no personal data to access, modify, or delete.
